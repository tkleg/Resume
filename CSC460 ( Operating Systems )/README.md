# Operating Systems

## Decsription of Class
- (Direct from the catalog) "A survey of functions of an operating system and the algorithms used in its implementation. Input/output programming, interrupt processing, memory management, demand paging, segmentation, processor management, scheduling, synchronization, multiprocessing, device management, dead-lock avoidance, information management, and interdependencies."
- The class is still in the early stages but focuses heavily on *C* with a fair bit of *bash* scripting as well.
- I will update the content of this folder with proejcst as I complete them.
