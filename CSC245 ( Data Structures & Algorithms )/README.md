# Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis

## Decsription of Class
- (Direct from Course Catalog) "A rigorous study of the implementation of different data structures, and an analysis of the
time and space complexity of their associated algorithms. Topics will include dynamic
memory, trees, hashing, heaps, sorting, graphs, and data encryption"
- In addition to the projects, this class was also very heavy in learning actual material
 - We had several tests on topics such as postfix, AVL trees, heaps, various sorting algorithms, hashing, and many more
- For the projects some of the utility files inclduing data structure files were given by the teacher. However the main programs were all written by myself
