## Source Code Version Control Tools

### Introduction

#### Importance of Version Control

Version control is crucial to software development. It allows developers to track changes made to code over time, revert to previous versions if necessary, and collaborate effectively on projects. Here are some key benefits:

* Prevents accidental breaks
* Feature development
* Collaboration

### Role of Version Control Systems (VCS)

Git is a popular open-source VCS that underpins many platforms like GitHub. There's a distinction between Git and a platform like GitHub:

* Git: is the software that tracks changes to your codebase and allows you to manage those changes locally on your machine.
* GitHub: is a web-based platform that provides a user interface for Git and additional features like collaboration tools, hosting your code repositories, and CI/CD pipelines (continuous integration and continuous delivery).

### Repository Setup

This section details the structure of your repository and the files it contains.

#### Repository Structure

The structure you've described seems suitable for a small project. Keep in mind that branching strategies can become more complex for larger projects.

* `./devcontainer`  : Contains `devcontainer.json` and `Dockerfile` for setting up the DevContainer environment.
* `./github`       : Contains YAML files likely used for building and deployment on GitHub Actions.
* `./app`           : Contains the core Flutter application code.
* `./docs`          : Contains markdown files explaining various aspects of the repository.
* `README.md`       : Provides instructions for running the application in a DevContainer.

#### Repository Integration with DevContainer and CI/CD Pipeline

Having the DevContainer configuration files in each branch allows users to easily start working on the project in a development environment.

### Standards and Conventions

Maintaining clear and concise commit messages is crucial for tracking changes effectively. 

### Common Commands and Usage

Here's a breakdown of some common Git commands with explanations:
-   ```git clone link to repo branch```: Clones the repository (alternatively use VSCode's source control tab)
-   ```cd app```: Navigates to the app directory from the base directory
-   ```clear```: Clears the terminal screen
-   ```flutter create app```: Creates a new Flutter base application
-   ```flutter run -d web-server```: Compiles the app and provides a link to access it
- ```flutter pub get```: Checks for dependencies
-   ```flutter --version```: Checks if Flutter is installed
-   ```git branch branch2```: Creates a new branch named "branch2"
-   ```git merge branch2```: Merges branch2 into the current branch
-   ```git status```: Shows the current branch and any uncommitted changes
-   ```git add files```: Stages specific files for commit
-   ```git commit -m message```: Commits staged changes with a message
-   ```git push```: Pushes committed changes to the remote repository

### Collaboration Features

Version control tools like Git facilitate collaboration through:

* Pull requests
* Code reviews
* Branching
* Conflict resolution

### Challenges and Solutions

It's good to document the challenges encountered and how they were resolved. This helps others learn from your experience.

### Conclusion

Using a VCS like Git offers numerous benefits for software projects. Choosing a platform like GitHub provides additional collaboration and management features. This project highlights the importance of version control for effective software development.
