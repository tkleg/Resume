## build.yaml documentation
The approach was basically to use what was shown in class and make the necessary adjustments. The issue I kept having was syntax, yaml indents are awful. After plenty of attempts I was able to get it to work. I also attempted to name some more steps but there were more syntax issues so I let that go.

### Update

I was able to get the pipeline finalized. There was a lot of trouble while testing because the app's unit tests were not complete. To get around this I removed the test from the ```build.yml``` until the test was working. I was able to get the pipeline fully functioning, except for the fact that I was unable to get the code coverage to be displayed in an html format. This did not matter however because an email automatically is sent to me when the code coverage test is ran.
