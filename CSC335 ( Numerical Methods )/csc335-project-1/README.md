# Instructions to Run the Main Program

1. Run `make main`.
2. Run `main`.
    - If using Gauss-Legendre integration, you must ensure that the file `legendre_064.dat` is in the same directory as the main executable. Otherwise, the weights and abscissae will be read as garbage and thus the calculated areas will all be completely wrong. The file is in the root of the repo just like the README file you are reading now.
