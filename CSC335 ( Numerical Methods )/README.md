# Numerical Methods

## Description of Class
- (Direct from the catalog) A study of numerical methods for the solution of mathematical problems and computer application of those methods. Topics will include methods such as the bisection algorithm and fixed point iteration for the solution of equations with a single variable, interpolation and polynomial approximation, numerical differentiation and integration, solution of systems of linear equations, and least squares approximation.
- The class is consisting of homeworks, large projects, and tests
