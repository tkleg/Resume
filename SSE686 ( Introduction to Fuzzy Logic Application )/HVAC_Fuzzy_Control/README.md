# Introduction to Fuzzy Logic Application

## Description of Class
- (Directly from Catalog) Course provides an introduction to concepts in Fuzzy Logic and provides hands on experience using Fuzzy Logics to solve real world problems in a context of a project. Fuzzy Logics are a part of computational intelligence, which is a rapidly growing area of artificial intelligence. This course will emphasize application of Fuzzy Logic widely used for addressing real-world problems related to decision making, control, image processing, etc. Fuzzy Logics can deal with incompleteness and lack of expert knowledge of the data, contrary to other Artificial Intelligence which requires exact knowledge. Course will introduce Fuzzy Logic engines/tools for hands on experience with design, calibration, and implementation of Fuzzy Logic in a programming setting.

### Project
- For this course I completed a project that involved creating a simple fuzzy logic system for HVAC to control the temperature and humidity of a room. Details and results can be seen in the two pdfs in the same directory this `README` file is in.
