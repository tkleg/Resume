Probable-Possible, my black hen,
She lays eggs in the Relative When.
She doesn't lay eggs in the Positive Now
Because she's unable to Postulate How.

###
There was a man in our town,
An Astrophysicist,
    Who found a place
    In Hyperspace
By just a twist of the wrist.

But when he sought the Near Now
And gave another twist,
    He found that he'd
    Become somehow
A Cyberneticist.

###
    Little Bo-Peep
    Has lost her sheep,
The radar has failed to find them.
    They'll all, face to face,
    Meet in parallel space,
Preceding their leaders behind them.

###
This little pig built a spaceship,
    This little pig paid the bill;
This little pig made isotopes,
    This little pig ate a pill;
And this little pig did nothing at all,
    But he's just a little pig still.

###
Flappity, Floppity, Flip!
The Mouse on the Mobius Strip.
    The Strip revolved,
    The Mouse dissolved
In a chronodimensional skip.

###
See the little phrases go,
    Watch their funny antics.
The men who make them wiggle so
    Are teachers of Semantics.

The words go up, the words go round
    And make a great commotion,
But all that lies behind the sound
    Is hebetude Boeotian.

###
The Hydrogen Dog and the Cobalt Cat
Side by side in the Armory sat.
Nobody thought about fusion or fission,
Everyone spoke of their peacetime mission,
    Till somebody came and opened the door.
There they were, in a neutron fog,
The Codrogen Cat and the Hybalt Dog;
    They mushroomed up with a terrible roar--
    And Nobody Never was there -- Nomore.
