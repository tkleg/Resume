## Goals
Currently looking to gain experience that will assist be in attaining a full-time job in the technology sector, preferrably in Software Engineering or Data Science.

## Language Skills
-   Java (Language of Preference)
    - Plenty of experience through school
    - Examples can be seen in the following directories
        - **CSC205**
        - **CSC330/FiveCardStud/java**
-   C++
    - While not as extensive with experience as Java, I still have done a fair amount of C++ coding and my current CSC310 (File Structures and Advanced Algorithms) class is almost entirely going to be in C++
    - Examples can be seen in the following directories
        - **CSC245**
        - **CSC310**
        - **CSC330/FiveCardStud/cpp**
-   x86 Assembly
    - My entire CSC322 (Computer Org & Assembly Language) class was in this language
    - Biggest project was a snake game
    - While I am rusty in this language I still do posess a basic understanding of most of the language and would have no trouble picking it back up if a job or assignment required it.
    - The repo for this class was unfortunately wiped due to the Gitlab account being remade when used for another class so the code has unfortunately been lost
-   Other Languages
    - In the **CSC330/FiveCardStud** and **CSC330/CollatzConjecture** directories you will notice a large amount of languages
        - These languages ( with the exception of Java and C++ ) I have not used elsewhere
        - However, due to the size of the projects and the time required on each language, I have become comfortable with coding in each.

## Automation Skills
- PowerAutomate
    - During my internship with Jazz Pharmaceuticals I learned how to use PowerAutomate to automate business processes. I did this by creating a workflow to handle a large part of the onboarding process for team members.
- Ivanti Neurons ITSM Workflows
    - I am using this tool in my current internship with the Mercer University IT Department
    - So far I have learned how to make Request Offerings and edit/create workflows

## Other Non-Programming Knowledge and Experience
- I have taken coursework in Computer Organization ( unsigned ints, signed ints, IEEE floating point format, RAM layout, logic design, etc. )
- Through my classes I am learning plenty about various algorithms and techniques for writing programs
- I am a part of the Binary Bears ( Mercer's Competitive Programming Team ) and have thus far taken part in two seperate competitions between colleges in the South-Eastern United States.
