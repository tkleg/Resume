## Goals
Currently looking to gain experience that will assist be in attaining a full-time job in the technology sector, preferrably in Software Engineering or Data Science.

## Language Skills
-   Java (Language of Preference)
    - Plenty of experience throughout high school and college.
    - Examples can be seen in the following directories.
        - **CSC205**
        - **CSC330/FiveCardStud/java**
        - **CSC335/csc335_homework/HW1**
        - **CSC335/csc335_homework/HW2**
-   C++ ( 2nd Language of Pregerence )
    - Only began learning this language with my **CSC245** course.
    - Examples can be seen in the following directories.
        - **CSC245**
        - **CSC310**
        - **CSC330/FiveCardStud/cpp**
        - **CSC335**
- Python
  - Not my most proficient language. First learning langauges such as java and c++ have made python significantly easier to learn.
  - Examples can be seen in the following directories.
    - **CSC330**
    - **CSC335/csc335-project-1/data_generators**
    - **CSC335/csc335_homework/HW2**
    - **High-School-Programming-Contest-Problems**
    - **SSE686**
-   x86 Assembly
    - My entire **CSC322** (Computer Org & Assembly Language) class was in this language
    - Biggest project was a snake game with simple `W A S D` controls.
    - While I am rusty in this language I still do posess a basic understanding of most of the language and would have no trouble picking it back up if a job or assignment required it.
    - The repo for this class was unfortunately wiped due to the Gitlab account being remade when used for another class, so the code has unfortunately been lost
-   Other Languages
    - In the **CSC330/FiveCardStud** and **CSC330/CollatzConjecture** directories you will notice a large amount of languages
        - Most of these languages I have not used elsewhere.
        - However, due to the size of the projects and the time required on each language, I have become comfortable with coding in each to a degree.
    - Bash & C
        - In my **CSC460** (Operating Systems) class I used bash and C. There also exists several bash files in various files that call my code for testing purposes.
    - Dart and YAML workflows
        - In my **CSC325** ( Application Development and Deployment ) class I made an app within a Docker dev container using Dart. If you follow the instructions on the README at the repo [HERE](https://github.com/tkleg/CSC325Pipeline) you can get the app running yourself. I have uploaded the code of the repo this repo as well. It can be found in the 

## Automation Skills
- PowerAutomate
    - During my internship with Jazz Pharmaceuticals I learned how to use PowerAutomate to automate business processes. I did this by creating a workflow to handle a large part of the onboarding process for team members.
- Ivanti Neurons ITSM Workflows
    - I am using this tool in my current internship with the Mercer University IT Department
    - So far I have learned how to make Request Offerings and edit/create workflows
- YAML
    - I used a YAML workflow in my **CSC325** course to publish an app. My experience with these workflows is minimal but I did get a basic grasp of it in the course.

## Other Programming Skills
- I gained experience using Springboot, and Angular during my internship with CVS Health.

## Other Non-Programming Knowledge and Experience
- I have taken coursework in Computer Organization ( unsigned ints, signed ints, IEEE floating point format, RAM layout, logic design, etc. )
- Through my classes I am learning plenty about various algorithms and techniques for writing programs
- I am a part of the Binary Bears ( Mercer's Competitive Programming Team ) and have thus far taken part in several seperate competitions between colleges in the South-Eastern United States.

## Disclaimer
- Not every program can be run on every machine. Most programs will require certain compiler versions, and some require external libraries. If you are interested in running any of the programs in this repository and are having trouble, please reach out with the contact info listed in **Resume.pdf**
- `safeDiner` and `mm1` in the `Operating Systems` class have bugs and do not fully work.
