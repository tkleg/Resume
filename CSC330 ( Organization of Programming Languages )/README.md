# Organization of Programming Languages

## Decsription of Class
- (Direct from the catalog) "A study of the concepts and issues underlying the design and implementation of
programming languages. Topics considered will be the objects of computation, grammars,
ambiguity, control structures, scope and typing of variables, block-structured languages,
precedence, recursion, and input/output facilities. Examples will be drawn from a highlevel language."
- The class consisted mostly of 3 main projects ( Five Card Stud, Collatz Conjecture, and a team Five Card Stud project )
- The **Assignments** folder was primarily written by the teacher, most of these files were simply edited by me slightly to make it do something different or to complete an incomplete program. The purpose of these were to help us understand how to do specific things in a specific language
- Note: I did not include the team Five Card Stud Project ( written in Lua ) here because I only wrote a very small portion of it and did not wanna be misleading as to my Lua skills

### Five Card Stud
- Out of the three class projects this certainly took the longest by far
- This project either generates 6 different hands or gets hands from a file and it ranks all the hands before displaying the results

### Collatz Conjecture
- This project focused more on the limits of each language ( integer size and time )
- This took much less time than the Five Card Stud Project but still took a considerable amount of hours to complete
- For the class final we had to use this code and modify it so that it would find the highest number computed when starting the conjecture at any number in a given range
    - Unfortunately this code was in a repo controlled by the teacher which has since been deleted so I could not include it here
