	The time was the middle sixties.  The computer was a famous
and closely held marvel; the day had not arrived when curious
undergraduates could buy the parts and figure out the thing by building
one themselves.  So he took a course in how to program a computer by
using a high-level computer language called FORTRAN, which was
developed for scientists mainly.

	I was a midnight programmer, he confessed.  During the first
nights after he learned to write a computer program, he would go off
from the computer room and search the empty building, looking for a
classroom with a blackboard and some chalk.  He posed problems for
himself and on the blackboard wrote up little programs for their
automatic solution.  The he hurried back to the computer to try out
his programs on the machine.  That was what made it fun;  he could
actually touch the machine and make it obey him.

	I'd run a little program and when it worked, I'd get a little
high, and then I'd do another.  It was neat.  I loved writing programs.
I could control the machine.  I could make it express my own thoughts.
It was an expansion of the mind to have a computer. The game of
programming - and it is a game - was so fascinating.  We'd stay up all
night and experience it.  It really is like a drug, I think.
